## SELECTING AN IDEA

The first step in earning an income is deciding what type of business you want to start. Some entrepreneurs choose to start a business in an area they're passionate about, whereas others choose a business idea based on academic factors. Nonetheless, the question a founder needs to ask themselves is: “What problem does my Firm solve and what need do my products fill?” There are many reasons why consumers make purchase
decisions, but the primary one is need. If you help enough people get what they want, you will ultimately get what you want as well.

## MARKET RESEARCH & FEASIBILITY

Market research after identifying your main area of focus is of utmost importance among the tasks you need to accomplish before you start your business. The point of market research is to gather facts and figures to make an informed decision about the market potential for your business. Keeping a good balance of being realistic and optimistic in business will certainly take you a long way. Knowing your market environment will inform you about your prospect of success and the direction your business would need to take whilst navigating the fast-paced business environment we find ourselves in today.
The main reason why many start ups fail is because they have ''Hit the financial wall''. This usually results from one or more of the following factors: insufficient and unrealistic estimate of the true cost of starting what you have in mind. There is nothing more dangerous than finding out that you need to spend more money than you have in the middle of running a product campaign;An expectation of resources you might tap into.- Do not remain stagnent while waiting for funding. Keep on focusing on income generating tasks to keep cashflow coming into your company. - A misconception about how quickly your company will start making money.

You need a well-researched estimate of what it will cost to start the business you have in mind will be and these figures need to be done properly to better increase the chances of your business succeeding. Bear in mind as well that you can match the reality of obtaining funding from a VC or institution for your idea. This may want you to refine your start up model and build a customer based target market focused business.

## NETWORK MARKETING

**"Network marketing is real world business school for people who want to learn the real world skills of an entrepreneur, rather than the skillset of an employee".** - Robert Kiyosaki. Author of [Rich Dad Poor Dad](http://fop86.com/Rich%20Dad%20Poor%20Dad/Rich%20Dad%20Poor%20Dad.pdf) 
  
Network marketing or Multi-level marketing is a business model that depends on person-to-person sales by independent representatives, often working from home. A network marketing business may require you to build a network of business partners or salespeople to assist with lead generation and closing sales.

# CRYPTOCURRENCY
 
Do you find yourself confused about cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin or Ether (associated with Ethereum)? You’re not alone. Before you use or invest in cryptocurrency, it is important to know what makes it different from cash and other payment methods, and how to spot cryptocurrency scams or detect cryptocurrency accounts that may be compromised.
  
## What is the blockchain?
 
A blockchain is a database that is distributed across the nodes of a computer network. They are known as distributed ledger technology (DLT). The blockchain is designed to record and distribute data, but editing or changing it is impossible. For use as a banking ledger, it makes sense as you obviously wouldn't want people editing their bank account balance. 
  
## How is Cryptocurrency used?
  
People use cryptocurrency for many reasons such as quick payments, to avoid transaction fees that traditional banks charge, or because of some anonymity benefits it offers. Others hold cryptocurrency as an investment, hoping the value goes up.
  
## How do I get a hold of cryptocurrency?
  
You can buy cryptocurrency through an exchange, an app, a website, or a cryptocurrency ATM. Some people earn cryptocurrency through a complex process called “mining,” which requires advanced computer equipment to solve highly complicated mathematical puzzles.
  
## Where and how do you store cryptocurrency?
  
Cryptocurrency is stored in a digital wallet, which can be online, on your computer, or on an external hard drive. A digital wallet has a wallet address, which is usually a long string of numbers and letters. If something happens to your wallet or your cryptocurrency funds — like your online exchange platform goes out of business, you send cryptocurrency to the wrong person, you lose the password to your digital wallet, or your digital wallet is stolen or compromised — you’re likely to find that no one can step in to help you recover your funds.

## How is Cryptocurrency different from the Rand/Dollar/Pound/Euro.. etc?
  
Cryptocurrency exists only online and there are important differences between cryptocurrency and traditional currency,

**Cryptocurrency accounts are not backed by a government.** Cryptocurrency held in accounts is not insured by a government like South African Rands deposited into an appopriate SA bank account. If something happens to your account or cryptocurrency funds — for example, the company that provides storage for your wallet goes out of business or is hacked — the government has no obligation to step in and help get your money back.
  
**Cryptocurrency values change constantly.** The value of a cryptocurrency can change rapidly, even changing by the hour. And the amount of the change can be significant. It depends on many factors, including supply and demand. Cryptocurrencies tend to be more volatile than more traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds. An investment that’s worth thousands of dollars today might be worth only hundreds tomorrow. And, if the value goes down, there’s no guarantee it will go up again.
